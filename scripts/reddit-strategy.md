# Reddit Growth Strategy - Don't Get Banned Edition

## The Reddit Rule: 90-9-1
- 90% - Comment/engage genuinely
- 9% - Share helpful content (not yours)
- 1% - Mention your product (when relevant)

**Translation**: You need to be helpful 99 times before you can "sell" once.

## Target Subreddits

### Tier 1: High-Intent (People Looking for Solutions)

#### r/CharacterAI (370k members)
**Vibe**: People already using AI companions, frustrated with limits
**Strategy**:
- Comment on complaints about C.AI limits
- Share experiences with different AI platforms
- When asked for alternatives, mention yours

**Example Comment**:
> "I had the same frustration with the filters. Ended up building my own platform where characters can be more... authentic. Happy to share if interested, but also check out [other alternatives]."

---

#### r/replika (94k members)
**Vibe**: Replika users, many looking for alternatives
**Strategy**:
- Empathize with recent Replika changes
- Share in "alternatives" threads
- Be respectful (people have emotional attachments)

**Example Comment**:
> "I get it. After the Replika changes, I was looking for something with more personality options. Found a few alternatives including one I'm working on. The ability to choose different personalities (goth, professional, playful, etc.) makes a huge difference."

---

#### r/AiCompanions (2k members)
**Vibe**: Smaller, but everyone is actively interested
**Strategy**: Just be honest here
- Share your journey building it
- Ask for feedback
- People here are early adopters

**Post Idea**:
> "I built an AI companion platform with 11 different personalities. What features matter most to you?"

---

### Tier 2: Adjacent Communities (Introduce the Concept)

#### r/lonely (390k members)
**Vibe**: People genuinely struggling with loneliness
**Strategy**: BE HELPFUL FIRST, SELL NEVER
- Share actual advice
- Comment on posts about late-night loneliness
- Only mention product if directly asked

**Example Comment** (on a "can't sleep, feeling alone" post):
> "2 AM loneliness is real. Some things that helped me:
> - Ambient sounds (rain, coffee shop)
> - Writing/journaling
> - Voice chat even if AI (sounds weird but helps)
>
> Whatever you choose, you're not alone in feeling this way."

Then if they ask "what AI chat?" you can share.

---

#### r/ForeverAlone (147k members)
**Similar to r/lonely**
**Warning**: Very sensitive community, be genuine
**Strategy**: Only engage if you genuinely understand the feeling

---

#### r/dating_advice (3.3M members)
**Vibe**: Dating struggles, loneliness, relationship questions
**Strategy**:
- Answer actual dating questions
- Build reputation as helpful
- Mention AI companions in "practice conversations" context

**Example Use Case**:
> "Before going on dates, I practiced conversations with an AI to build confidence. Sounds silly but it helped with social anxiety."

---

#### r/socialanxiety (300k members)
**Vibe**: People afraid of human interaction
**Strategy**:
- Share how AI helped you practice
- Frame as "training wheels" not replacement
- Be sensitive - these are real struggles

---

### Tier 3: Tech/AI Communities (Builder Angle)

#### r/ChatGPT (3.3M members)
**Vibe**: AI enthusiasts, curious about applications
**Strategy**: Share as builder, not seller
- "Show HN" style posts
- Technical discussions
- Ask for feedback

**Post Idea**:
> "Built an AI companion platform with personality-specific models. Technical challenges and learnings [Discussion]"

---

#### r/ArtificialIntelligence (1M members)
**Similar vibe to r/ChatGPT**
**Strategy**: Focus on the tech/ethical discussions

---

#### r/LocalLLaMA (254k members)

## Reddit Post Templates

### "I Built This" Post (for r/AiCompanions, r/ChatGPT)

```markdown
Title: Built an AI companion platform with 11 distinct personalities - lessons learned

Hey everyone, spent the last [timeframe] building ChatVerse, an AI companion platform. Not here to sell, genuinely want to share what worked/didn't.

**What it is**: 11 AI characters with distinct personalities (goth, professional, playful, etc.)

**Technical stack**:
- Next.js for multi-domain routing
- ElevenLabs for voice
- Supabase for persistence
- OpenRouter for LLM flexibility

**Biggest challenges**:
1. Making personalities feel distinct (not just different system prompts)
2. Memory persistence across conversations
3. Multi-domain SEO
4. Monetization balance (free vs paid)

**What surprised me**:
- People really value personality variety
- Voice features are HUGE for engagement
- Users want NSFW options (controversial but true)

Happy to answer questions about the tech, user behavior, or monetization. Also happy to hear what features you'd want in an ideal AI companion.

[Link only if asked]
```

### "Ask for Advice" Post

```markdown
Title: What features matter most in AI companions? Building v2.0

Working on v2 of my AI companion platform. Current features:
- 11 personalities
- Voice messages
- Memory persistence
- NSFW option

What features would make you actually use it? What's missing from current platforms?

Real feedback wanted, not just "cool bro" comments.
```

---

### Comment Template (When Asked for Alternatives)

```markdown
I've tried most of the alternatives. Here's my quick take:

**Character.AI**: Best variety but heavy filters
**Replika**: Good emotional support, limited personality
**Chai**: Hit or miss, depends on creator
**[Your Platform]**: Full disclosure - I built this one. 11 personalities, voice support, NSFW option. Biased obviously but happy to share if you want to try.

Whatever you choose, hope you find what works for you!
```
