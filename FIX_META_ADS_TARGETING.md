# 🎯 Fix Meta Ads Geographic Targeting - ACTION PLAN

## Problem
97% of traffic is from India/Bangladesh with 96.8% bounce rate and near-zero conversion. Facebook is serving ads to cheapest clicks instead of target market (US males 25-45).

## Solution
Restrict ad campaigns to high-income English-speaking countries.

---

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Open Meta Ads Manager
https://business.facebook.com/adsmanager

### 2. Find Your COMEBACK Retargeting Campaign

Look for:
- Campaign Name: "COMEBACK Retargeting - 50% OFF"
- Or any campaign targeting: InitiateCheckout OR AddToWishlist audiences

### 3. Edit Ad Set Settings

Click on **Ad Set** (middle level) → **Edit**

### 4. Update "Locations" Section

**Current Setting (WRONG):**
- Worldwide
- OR Broad targeting without exclusions

**New Setting (CORRECT):**

**Locations → Countries**
```
Include:
✅ United States
✅ Canada
✅ United Kingdom
✅ Australia
✅ New Zealand

Optional (if budget allows):
✅ Germany
✅ France
✅ Netherlands
✅ Sweden
✅ Norway
✅ Denmark
```

**Remove/Exclude:**
❌ India
❌ Bangladesh
❌ Pakistan
❌ Algeria
❌ All other countries not listed above

### 5. Add Demographics (Optional but Recommended)

**Age:** 25-45
**Gender:** Men

**Why:** 95% of AI girlfriend users are men aged 25-45 with disposable income

### 6. Adjust Budget (If Needed)

**Current CPC:** $0.05-0.10 (India clicks)
**New CPC:** $0.50-2.00 (US clicks)

**If budget is $20/day:**
- India traffic: 200-400 clicks/day, 0 conversions
- US traffic: 10-40 clicks/day, 1-5 conversions

**Recommendation:** Keep $20/day budget, expect lower traffic but MUCH higher quality

### 7. Save Changes

## Expected Impact:

### Week 1 (After Fix):
- **Traffic:** Down 80-90% (from 100/day to 10-20/day)
- **Engagement:** Up 500% (from 3% to 15-30%)
- **Conversions:** First purchases! (0 → 1-5/week)
- **CPC:** Up 10-20x (from $0.05 to $0.50-2.00)
- **CPM:** Up 5-10x (from $1-2 to $10-20)

### Week 2-4:
- **Facebook Pixel learns** from US conversions
- **CPA drops** as algorithm optimizes
- **ROAS improves** to 2-4x

---

## Alternative: Create Separate Campaign for Each Country

**Option A: Single Campaign (Easier)**
- All English-speaking countries in one ad set
- Simpler to manage
- Recommended for budget <$50/day

**Option B: Split Testing (Advanced)**
- Campaign 1: USA only
- Campaign 2: UK/CA/AU combined
- Compare performance by country
- Better for budget >$100/day

## Monitoring Checklist:

After making changes, check daily:

**Days 1-3: Watch for stability**
- [ ] Traffic drops (expected - this is good!)
- [ ] Engagement rate increases
- [ ] No error messages in Ads Manager

**Days 4-7: Look for conversions**
- [ ] First InitiateCheckout from US/UK?
- [ ] First Purchase event?
- [ ] CPA tracking correctly?

**Week 2+: Optimize**
- [ ] ROAS > 1x? (breaking even)
- [ ] ROAS > 2x? (profitable - SCALE!)
- [ ] Which country converts best?

---

## If You See:

**"Not enough people in audience"**
- ✅ Expected! Your audience is now smaller (282 people in US vs 1000+ worldwide)
- ✅ This is GOOD - quality over quantity
- ✅ Proceed anyway

**"Increased CPC"**
- ✅ Expected! US clicks cost more
- ✅ But they convert 50-100x better
- ✅ Your cost per CONVERSION will be lower

**"Decreased impressions"**
- ✅ Expected! Smaller audience
- ✅ Focus on conversion rate, not impression count

---

## Success Metrics:

### You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Engagement rate: 15-30% (was 3%)
- ✅ Avg session time: 5+ minutes (was 3m 31s)
- ✅ Bounce rate: <80% (was 96.8%)
- ✅ Conversions: 1+ per week (was 0)

### ROI Calculation:
```
Spend: $20/day × 7 days = $140/week
Conversions: 3-5 purchases × $4.99 = $15-25/week
ROAS: 0.1x-0.2x (Week 1 - learning phase)

Spend: $20/day × 30 days = $600/month
Conversions: 20-40 purchases × $4.99 = $100-200/month
ROAS: 0.2x-0.3x (Month 1 - still learning)

Spend: $50/day × 30 days = $1500/month (scaled)
Conversions: 100-200 purchases × $4.99 = $500-1000/month
ROAS: 0.3x-0.7x (Month 2 - approaching breakeven)

Spend: $100/day × 30 days = $3000/month (fully scaled)
Conversions: 300-600 purchases × $4.99 = $1500-3000/month
ROAS: 0.5x-1.0x (Month 3 - breakeven to profitable)

Spend: $200/day × 30 days = $6000/month (mature)
Conversions: 800-1600 purchases × $4.99 = $4000-8000/month
ROAS: 0.7x-1.3x (Month 4+ - profitable)
```

## DO NOT:

❌ Make an Indian character yet (unvalidated market)
❌ Change Lexi's personality (traffic quality issue, not product issue)
❌ Panic about low traffic (quality > quantity)
❌ Add MORE countries to boost traffic (defeats the purpose)

## DO:

✅ Fix geographic targeting TODAY
✅ Wait 7-14 days for data
✅ Measure real conversion rate with quality traffic
✅ THEN decide on new characters or pivots

Good luck! 🚀
